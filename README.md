# Neighborhood-Investment-Tool
This repository is meant to aid in the creation of a Neighborhood Investment Tool for a GEOG 565 Final Project at UW (Summer 2015). The tool aims to measure the number of building permits per neighborhood. The focus area for the use of this tool is Detroit, MI.
The two primary inputs are a neighborhoods polygon shapefile and a permits point shapefile
