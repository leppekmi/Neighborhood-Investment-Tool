## We should make lots of notes in our code!

## Look...I can write a note in here!-Hilary

## This is to practice a pull request...

##import system modules
import arcpy
from arcpy import env

##Set environment workspace (I'm assuming we'll need to change this eventually for it to work as a toolbox)
env.workspace = r"XXX"

##Set local variables maybe??-

##Execute AddField to add a new field
arcpy.AddField_management()
